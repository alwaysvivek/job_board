## ✅ Day 4: Prepare for Interviews (2 hours)

### Step 1: Practice Your Project Pitch (30 seconds)
```
"I built a full-stack job board using Next.js 15 and TypeScript that 
demonstrates production-ready patterns. It features server-side rendering 
for performance, full authentication with NextAuth, and achieves 95+ 
Lighthouse scores. I implemented comprehensive testing with Playwright and 
Vitest, and made it fully accessible with ARIA labels. The project shows 
I can build professional applications following modern best practices."
```

### Step 2: Prepare Common Question Answers

**Q: "Walk me through your project"**
```
A: "I built this job board to learn modern full-stack development. 

First, I set up Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. I chose Next.js 
for its built-in SSR and image optimization.

For authentication, I used NextAuth.js with bcrypt for secure password 
hashing. Users can sign up, sign in, and post jobs.

The database is managed with Prisma ORM, which gives me type-safe queries. 
This connects perfectly with TypeScript.

For state management, I used TanStack Query for server data, which handles 
caching and refetching automatically.

I implemented testing with Playwright for E2E tests (like user sign up flow) 
and Vitest for unit tests.

For accessibility, I used semantic HTML, ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation 
to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

Finally, I deployed to Vercel, which automatically handles CI/CD and provides 
great Next.js optimization."
```

**Q: "What was the biggest challenge?"**
```
A: "The biggest challenge was understanding Next.js 15's App Router, especially 
the difference between Server and Client Components. I had to learn when to 
use 'use client' and how to properly handle data fetching.

I spent time reading the documentation and experimenting. Eventually, I 
understood that Server Components are the default and better for performance, 
while Client Components are needed for interactivity like forms.

This taught me the importance of reading official docs carefully and 
understanding the 'why' behind architectural decisions."
```

**Q: "What would you improve?"**
```
A: "There are a few things I'd add next:

1. Search functionality - right now you can only filter by job type
2. Email notifications - notify users about relevant new jobs
3. More comprehensive test coverage - I have basic tests but could add more 
   edge cases
4. Job bookmarking - let users save jobs they're interested in

I prioritized getting the core features working well with good code quality 
rather than adding every possible feature."
```

**Q: "Why no internship experience?"**
```
A: "During my studies, I focused on building strong projects to learn modern 
technologies hands-on. I wanted to ensure I understood production-ready 
patterns, not just academic concepts.

While I don't have professional experience, I've invested significant time 
learning industry best practices through documentation, online courses, and 
building this project. I'm confident I can apply these skills in a team 
environment and continue learning from experienced developers."
```

### Step 3: Prepare Questions to Ask Them
```
1. "What does the onboarding process look like for junior developers?"
2. "How does the team approach code reviews and knowledge sharing?"
3. "What tech stack would I be working with day-to-day?"
4. "What would success look like for me in the first 3-6 months?"
5. "How do you support the growth of junior developers?"
6. "What are the most common challenges for new developers on your team?"
7. "What's the team's approach to testing and code quality?"
```
