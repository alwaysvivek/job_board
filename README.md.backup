# Job Board — Modern Full-Stack Rewrite (Next.js 15)

A modern, high-performance job board built with **Next.js 15**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. This project re-imagines the classic *“Let’s Build: With Ruby on Rails”* Job Board series using today’s React ecosystem.

This project focuses on clean UX, type safety, testing, and Core Web Vitals, while intentionally removing payments to keep the core product simple, extensible, and deployment-friendly.

## 🚀 Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

This project is optimized for deployment on Vercel:

1. **Push to GitHub:** Ensure your code is pushed to a GitHub repository
2. **Import to Vercel:** Connect your repository in the Vercel dashboard
3. **Environment Variables:** Add the following in Vercel settings:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
   NEXTAUTH_URL=your_production_url
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret_key
   ```
4. **Deploy:** Vercel will automatically build and deploy your app

### Database Setup

* **Recommended:** Use [Neon](https://neon.tech/) or [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for serverless PostgreSQL
* Run migrations: `npx prisma db push` or `npx prisma migrate deploy`
* Seed data (optional): `npx prisma db seed`

### Build Configuration

The project is pre-configured for Vercel with:
* Automatic Prisma Client generation during build
* Next.js 15 optimizations enabled
* TypeScript strict mode
* Production-ready environment handling

### Interview Talking Points

1. **"I learned by doing"** - Extended an open-source project with custom features
2. **"Full-stack capabilities"** - Built both frontend UI and backend API endpoints
3. **"Type-safe development"** - Used TypeScript throughout for better code quality
4. **"Real-world features"** - Implemented search, filtering, user dashboards, not just basic CRUD
5. **"Production deployment"** - Deployed and running on Vercel with real database
6. **"Security conscious"** - Implemented authentication, authorization, and input validation

## 🚀 Getting Started (For Freshers)

If you're a fresher looking to understand or extend this project:

1. **Clone and explore** the codebase structure

3. **Study** the API routes in `/app/api` to learn backend development
4. **Experiment** by adding small features or styling changes
5. **Deploy** your own version to Vercel to showcase to employers

### Recommended Learning Path

1. Start with the **job listing page** (`app/page.tsx`) - understand data fetching
2. Explore **components** - see how reusable UI is built
3. Study **API routes** - learn how backend endpoints work
4. Review **authentication** flow in `lib/auth.ts`
5. Understand **database schema** in `prisma/schema.prisma`
